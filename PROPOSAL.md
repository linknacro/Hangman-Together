# Final Project Proposal

For my final project, I want to make a **Hangman** where the player can either play with a computer or a different player.
In this game:
* There will be two modes
	- The player will be able to guess a random word generated by the computer
	- The player will be able to guess a word typed in by another person
* There will be graphics. Whenever there is a wrong guess, the hangman gets a limb
* There will be sound when the player makes a wrong guess

#### External Libraries & Plugins
I will be using **ofxBox2d** to make the game look more interesting and [ofSoundPlayer](https://openframeworks.cc/documentation/sound/ofSoundPlayer/) to add sound to the game

#### My Background for this Project
This will be nice personal project and a great way to learn about Openframeworks. I will greatly appreciate this learning opportunity and get valuable experiences out of it.

#### Timeline
- Week 1
	- Make sure that my external libraries and plugins work
	- Roughly finish the backend of the project
- Week 2
	- Start working on the front end of the project
	- Integrate the sound and graphics functions
- Week 3
	- Putting everything together to make the game work as a whole
	- Play with other people to test the performance of the game
- Week 4
	- Debugging 
	- Keep improving the performance of the game
