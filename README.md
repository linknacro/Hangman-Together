# Hangman

## Description
This is a hangman game with two game modes. 
- In the single player mode, the player plays the classic hangman game with a word randomly chosen from the word bank. 
- In the multiplayer mode, one player types in the word, and the other player will guess that word. The player has 6 guesses for each word.

At the end of each game, the player can reset the game and choose game mode again. All the required instructions are provided in the game.
